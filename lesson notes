### Runes and thier properties

  - ' **%-** ' **cenhep**, for applying a function (add, div, pow, etc)
  - ' **^-** ' **cethep**, for enforcing or converting the data type (aura)
  - ' **:^** ' **colhep**, for making a cell (pair of nouns)
  - ' **=/** ' **tisfas**, Assigns a name to a value (kinda like var)
  - ' **?:** ' **wutcol**, Make a boolean style decision



**%- cenhep**

        Various functions/operations (gate) that can be called using %-

        'add'
        'sub'
        'mul'
        'div'
        'pow'
        'gth' - greater than

**^- kethep**



        Types of values/auras (there are more than just these - maybe 32?)

        @ud - unsigned decimal - 1.000.056
        @ux - unsigned hexdecimal - 0x5f5.e138
        @ub - unsigned binary - 0b11.1000
        @t - Strait text (string) - 'bebop & rocksteady'
        @da - Absolute Date - ~2018.5.14
        @rs - Single precision (32 bits) - .6.022141e23
        @p - Phonemic base (ship name) - ~litneb-maltyp





### General notes

- The most general data category in hoon is a 'noun' (like a thing) and its either an atom or a cell
- An atom is  any non zero integer
- a Cell is a pair of any two nouns (values)
- Unsigned means 'no particular + or - value'
- 1000 seperator is the German convention '.' not ',' one thousand is 1.000
- Apply operation with tick marks and aura - "''@ub'" this is an operation that does the work of passing the value through the empty aura first before applying the conversion command
- Empty aura "@" defaults to raw/naked value. use that new value to convert into something new
- "ace" seperates certain values, "gap" seperates the children of a rune
- Short cut for building a cell with %- ....[2 3] ----> [%-(add [1 1]) 3] (this is short form ace instead of gap)
- %.n is false - %.y is true
